---
---
Conducting this Project has been a worthwile experience, that has taught me both technical and essesntial general life skills. Through this project i have learnt the importance of resilience, trial and error , reasearch, analytical thinking ,computational thinking and most importantly communication and storytelling.

I will explain in steps the problems i faced during this assignment and the steps i took to solve them:

## Task 1
---
I had some experience with python before hand so i was familiar with the data cleaning concepts, however the b part of this task involved removing rows where there was a mismatch between siteid and name. i had to think outside the box and manually create a dictionary that showed the right match and then define a function that checked the whole dataset for mismatches, this definitely involved me thinking outside the box and taught me how to use python to solve the problem in front me.

## Task 2
---
In this task i learnt how to build a conceptual model, and practicalised what i learnt in class to solve an actual problem, i learnt how to build a model in a normalised form and cemented my understanding of entity relationships, Foreign Keys, and Primary keys.

## Task 3
---
This task was where i started having some difficulty, because i use an m1 mac, which uses an m1 chip a different processor from other laptops which mainly use intel or nvidia, i found myself encountering numerous errors when installing mysql server or setting up database connections. Through days of persistent research i came across docker an application which allows you to setup containers to house all connections and dependencies, through this i found a workaround to install the server needed create my database and connect to my databse, to complete the task.

## Task 4
---
Here i found out some problems in my readings and had to go back to my populate script and make changes such as changing the date of the readings to date time format. I improved my knowledge of sql and learnt how to run queries on the databse. I also discovered insight on bristol air data, such as finding out the most air polluted area in bristol which was Colston avenue, which makes sense duue to all of the gas emissions from cars, as it is right at the centre of bristol

## Task 5
---
I learnt about nosql databses and how to forward engineer data into one, i also learnt about different types of formats and modelling for these formats, i moddeled the queried csv data compiled from my sql databse and mapped it to mongodb a nosql databse in json format, using an aggregate function.

Other skills learnt:
##### Terminal
---
i gained extensive knowledge on how to use the terminal to navigate directories, remove files, as well as writing programme scripts straight from the terminal

##### Virtual machines
---
In my attempt to find a workaround for the incompatibility of my laptop with the programmes i needed to run, i learnt about virtual machines and ended up installing instances of windows and kali linux, i am currently exploring these operating systems and learning how to use them

##### General skills
---
This assignment taught me how to communicate with people to solve a problem, and how there are numerous perspectives to view problems and devise solutions. I have made good friends, increased my confidence in my technical and social skills and opened up career prospects through this assignment.

#### Future plans for the data
---
I plan on running hypothesis tests and running multivariate regression models on some variables in the data, mostly relationships with in the concentration of various gases as well as the relationships between location and the concentration of these gases.

i would use seaborn to visualise a correlation heatmap and see the best correlations to use for my tests, matplotlib pyplot as well as seaborn will be used for the regression visualisations
